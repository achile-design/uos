    "Sequel to the above business understanding, the <b>objective</b> of this research is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To identify the spread of the intensity of customer sentiment across United State and Territory\n",
    "2. To identify weeknesses in the collection and storage of data with a view to mititgate ineffective customer communication and combat the risk of cyber security if neccessary.\n",
